### Level 4

Okey we have this image. First let's see if there is any comments.
Goto http://regex.info/exif.cgi and type in the url to the image

We find this base64 string:
`R2plbmJydWsgYXYgcGFzc29yZCBlciBldCBhbHQgZm9yIHZhbmxpZyBmZW5vbWVuLiBLYW5za2plIGRldCBrYW4gYnJ1a2VzIHRpbCBkaW4gZm9yZGVsIGhlcj8=`

Which converts to:
`Gjenbruk av passord er et alt for vanlig fenomen. Kanskje det kan brukes til din fordel her?`

The text suggests that maybe a previous password also works on this case, but I have no idea what to do next.
